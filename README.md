### Project Description
The **Social-Media-Template** website consists of 2 pages, created as a part of my scholarship at **ITI**.
The task was to build a multi section landing page with dynamically built navigation, login and Validate it. 

### Building
To build I followed the following steps: 

- Setting up the environment
- Building out my HTML5 with at least three content sections using BootStrap.
- Building the navigation menu.
- Adding functionality to distinguish the section in view.
- Refactoring and testing the performance.
- Login page with validation.
- In addition, used cookies. When you sign your name it will display on the home page.
